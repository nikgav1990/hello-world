# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Nikos Gavalas and i am studying Informatics at University of West Attica in Greece.
I like writing code in HTML,CSS,Javascript and more programming languages.My first project is a lab project based on WebGL and Javascript.It represents a robot on a floor with specific dimensions.It also has three choices to move.By pressing one of them,robot either falls down and gets up immediately either moves it's hands or legs either happens "failure".
