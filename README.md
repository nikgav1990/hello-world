# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Nikos Gavalas and i am studying Informatics at University of West Attica in Greece.
I like writing code in HTML,CSS,Javascript and more programming languages.My first project is a lab project based on WebGL and Javascript.It represents a robot on a floor with specific dimensions.It also has three choices to move.By pressing one of them,robot either falls down and gets up immediately either moves it's hands or legs either happens "failure".

Could anyone tell me how to make the robot moves when the animations its stopped,only by moving the MOUSE WHEEL and not the mouse itself? I have tried to fix in my lab project but didn't make it.
